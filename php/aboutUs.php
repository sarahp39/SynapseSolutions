						THE PROBLEM:
					</p>
					<p>
						The problem can best be described by a quote from our cofounder, Dr. Andrea Stocco.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						"We currently have a terrible infrastructure for data analysis of EEG 
						data. Our pipeline for resting state EEG is established and has lead to 
						a lot of publications, but is very error-prone and written in R, with no 
						flexibility and no user interfaceâ€¦ our interface for data analysis, sharing, 
						and Q/A is non-existent and rough."

				<div id = "solution" class = "generalBorder" >
					<p class = "generalHeading">
						THE SOLUTION:
					</p>
					<p>
						Synapse Solutions is an online platform that provides researchers with 
						a tool to work with and analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) data. This solution 
						that we have created will allow for a user friendly and less error prone analysis with 
						an interface that will provide an opportunity for customization of parameters.
